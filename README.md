# eml-parse-py

## Purpose:
A CLI based SMTP Message analysis tool, for things such as parsing individual entities, and constructing reports, and sending them via another SMTP message *



SMTP message sending functionality planned... * 


## How to use:

If you're utilising the CLI to manipulation mails here is how to do that:

`` python app.py [OPTION] [FILE]``

Options:

Print the header from address ``` --hfrom /path/to/file.eml```

Print the header to address ```- -hto /path/to/file.eml ```

Print the subject of the msg ``` --hsubject /path/to/file.eml```

Print the Reply-to address of the msg ``` --hreply-to /path/to/file.eml```

Print the Msg ID of the Msg  ```--hmsg-id /path/to/file.eml ```

Print the date of the msg:  ```--hdate /path/to/file.eml ```

Print the full Msg out: ``` --file /path/to/file.eml```

Create HTML file comprised of the attributes found in the eml : ```--makehtml /path/to/file.eml``` * Functionality is WIP..
